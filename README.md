# 🧠 Data Analysis with Python – freeCodeCamp Certification

This repository contains the five required projects for the [freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).

Each project demonstrates proficiency in real-world data analysis, including:
- Data cleaning and manipulation using **pandas** and **NumPy**
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Statistical analysis and reproducible reporting


## 📁 Projects

### 1. 📊 Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
- A function that computes basic descriptive statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, sum) across rows, columns, and the flattened matrix of a 3x3 list input.

### 2. 🧮 Demographic Data Analyzer
- Analyzes a dataset of adult incomes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- Extracts insights such as racial distribution, education level, work hours, and income brackets.


### 3. 🧬 Medical Data Visualizer
- Cleans and visualizes medical examination data (BMI, cholesterol, glucose, etc.).
- Produces categorical plots and heatmaps to explore correlations between health indicators.

### 4. 📈 Page View Time Series Visualizer
- Uses a time series dataset of daily page views to produce:
  - Line plot over time
  - Monthly average bar plots
  - Box plots by year and month

### 5. 🌊 Sea Level Predictor
- Analyzes global sea level rise using historical data.
- Uses linear regression to model trends and predict sea levels through the year 2050.
